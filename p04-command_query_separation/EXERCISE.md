# Interface Extraction

This is a pretty simple exercise, which just enhances our code base slightly (as groundwork for
some later step).

Introduce a `Scanner` interface and rename the current `Scanner` class to something else. Of course
this class should implement the interface.

Note that you can use your IDE refactoring features to help you with this.

As in previous exercises you can diff your code against the next up module for a peek at
a possible solution.
